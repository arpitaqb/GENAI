Good evening everyone, and thank you for being here today. 
As we gather in this moment of reflection and possibility, let us remember that progress isn't always loud — sometimes, it’s the quiet persistence of ordinary people doing extraordinary things. 
Whether it's innovation in science, acts of kindness in our communities, or the resilience we show in the face of adversity, each action matters. Together, we can build a future that honors our past and embraces the potential of every individual. Let’s commit to collaboration, courage, and compassion as we move forward into the unknown with hope.
